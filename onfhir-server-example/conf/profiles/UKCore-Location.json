  "description": "Defines the UK Core constraints and extensions on the Location resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve location information.",
  "purpose": "This profile can be used to exchange details and position information for a physical place where services are provided and resources and participants may be stored, found, contained, or accommodated.\r\nA location includes both incidental locations (a place which is used for healthcare without prior designation or authorisation) and dedicated, formally appointed locations. Locations may be private, public, mobile or fixed and scale from small freezers to full hospital buildings or parking garages.",
